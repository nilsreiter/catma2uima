# CATMA2UIMA

This repository contains a single collection reader. The reader takes TEI/XML files 
exported from [CATMA 5](https://catma.de), and converts them into UIMA format. Please note
that all CATMA-annotations are stored using the UIMA type `CatmaAnnotation`, with 
features `CatmaType` and `Properties` to store the annotation category and potential 
additional features.
